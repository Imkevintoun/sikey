SIKEY – Future Economic Layer (Exploratory)

Status: Conceptual / Non-Live
Purpose: Alignment, Incentives, and Protocol Sustainability
Note: SIKEY does not currently issue a token. This document outlines why a native utility token may be introduced in the future and the principles that would govern it.

1. Why an Economic Layer May Be Necessary

SIKEY is designed as a self-sovereign digital identity protocol — open-source, decentralised, and resistant to capture.

As the protocol grows, certain challenges naturally emerge:

Sustaining long-term open-source development

Incentivising high-quality contributions

Preventing spam, abuse, and Sybil attacks

Enabling decentralised governance without central authority

Funding infrastructure without surveillance, ads, or subscriptions

A native utility token — SIK Coin — is being explored as a tool, not a product, to address these challenges without compromising sovereignty.

2. What SIK Coin Is (and Is Not)
SIK Coin Is:

A protocol utility token

A mechanism for aligning incentives

A way to reward contribution

A potential governance and staking primitive

Designed to protect decentralisation and autonomy

SIK Coin Is Not:

A speculative asset

A fundraising mechanism

A promise of financial return

A replacement for identity

A requirement to use SIKEY

3. Core Principles

Any future implementation of SIK Coin will adhere to the following principles:

3.1 Utility First

The token must solve real protocol problems.
If it does not meaningfully improve SIKEY, it will not exist.

3.2 Earned, Not Sold

SIK Coin is intended to be earned through contribution, not purchased through a public sale.

3.3 Open-Source Alignment

Token distribution must reward:

Developers

Researchers

Auditors

Node operators

Community contributors

3.4 Anti-Extraction

The token model must avoid:

VC capture

Insider advantage

Rent-seeking behaviour

Pay-to-play governance

3.5 Sovereignty Preserving

Use of SIK Coin must never:

Compromise privacy

Introduce surveillance

Force identity disclosure

Centralise power

4. Potential Use Cases

These are exploratory and not final.

4.1 Contributor Incentives

Rewards for meaningful code contributions

Grants for research, audits, and tooling

Bounties for protocol improvements

4.2 Network Security & Anti-Sybil

Optional staking for:

Validators

Verifiers

Attestation providers

Economic cost for malicious behaviour

4.3 Governance (Opt-In)

Protocol upgrades

Parameter changes

Treasury proposals

Community decision-making

Governance is opt-in and does not override individual sovereignty.

4.4 Protocol Services

Optional payments for:

Verifications

Credential issuance

Attestation services

Decentralised infrastructure usage

All services remain permissionless.

5. Non-Goals

SIKEY explicitly rejects the following:

Token price optimisation

Marketing-driven token launches

Artificial scarcity narratives

Forced token usage

Financialisation of identity

6. Launch Conditions (If Ever)

SIK Coin will not be introduced unless:

The core SIKEY protocol is live and usable

There is an active contributor ecosystem

A token clearly improves decentralisation

Governance requires an economic layer

The community broadly supports its introduction

If these conditions are not met, no token will be launched.

7. Regulatory & Ethical Position

SIKEY does not promote:

Investment activity

Financial speculation

Token trading

Any future token would be positioned as:

A protocol utility

A governance and incentive mechanism

A non-custodial, non-promotional digital asset

8. Community Feedback

This document exists to:

Invite discussion

Encourage collaboration

Signal long-term intent without hype

Feedback, critique, and alternative designs are welcome.

SIKEY’s priority is trust, not speed.

9. Status

This document is:

Informational

Non-binding

Subject to change

Provided in good faith

SIKEY reserves the right to never introduce a token.

10. Summary

SIK Coin is not a promise — it is a possibility.

Its existence depends entirely on whether it:

Strengthens sovereignty

Improves decentralisation

Serves contributors

Protects the protocol

If it cannot do all four, it will not exist.

🗝️ SIKEY

Identity without permission.
Sovereignty without compromise.
