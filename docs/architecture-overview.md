# Architecture Overview (Draft)

This document will describe the high-level architecture of SIKEY.

Planned sections:

- Core entities:
  - Subjects (people)
  - Issuers
  - Verifiers
- Key hierarchy and SIK derivation
- DID / identifier strategy
- Credential storage (on-device, off-chain, on-chain options)
- ZK proof flows
- Revocation and recovery

_This will be expanded as design discussions progress._
