# Threat Model (Draft)

Because SIKEY is about identity and sovereignty, we must be explicit about threats.

Initial threat categories to consider:

- State-level surveillance and coercion
- Corporate data harvesting and profiling
- Key compromise (theft, coercion, malware)
- Metadata correlation (tracking across apps / verifiers)
- Malicious issuers or verifiers
- Protocol misuse or hostile forks

This file will grow into a detailed threat model that informs all design decisions.
