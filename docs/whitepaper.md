# SIKEY Whitepaper (Work in Progress)

This is the working whitepaper for the **SIKEY – Sovereign Identity Key** protocol.

It will eventually include:

- Problem statement
- Threat model
- Identity model and key hierarchy
- Credential / attestation formats
- ZK proof flows and cryptographic choices
- Governance considerations
- Example use cases and integration patterns

For now, this is just a placeholder to anchor future work.
