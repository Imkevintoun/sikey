# SIKEY Manifesto (Draft v0.1)

> Digital ID without surveillance. Identity without permission.  
> For humans, not systems.

This document will evolve. Its purpose is to clearly state:

- What SIKEY stands for
- What problems it exists to solve
- The values and non-negotiables of the protocol and community

## Core Principles (Draft)

1. **Self-Sovereignty** – Individuals must own and control their identity keys.
2. **Privacy by Design** – The system must minimise data collection and enable selective disclosure + zero-knowledge proofs.
3. **Open Protocol, Not a Platform** – Anyone can implement, fork, or integrate SIKEY.
4. **No Single Point of Control** – Governance should resist capture by states, corporations, or foundations.
5. **Interoperability** – SIKEY should play nicely with existing identity standards (DIDs, VCs, etc.) where possible.

_This is a placeholder. Future updates will expand this into a full manifesto._
