# Code of Conduct

SIKEY is a project about **freedom, sovereignty, and respect**. To keep this space constructive:

- Be respectful. No harassment, abuse, bigotry, or personal attacks.
- Critique ideas, not people.
- Assume good intent, but don’t ignore harmful behaviour.
- No doxxing or sharing of private information.
- No advocating for surveillance, hate, or violence.

If you see behaviour that violates this:

- Email: `sikey-project@proton.me` (replace with your real contact when ready), or  
- Open a private issue with the maintainers.

Maintainers may warn, block, or remove contributions from people who don’t respect this.
