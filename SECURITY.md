# Security Policy

Because SIKEY deals with identity, privacy, and cryptography, security is critical.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you’ve found a security or privacy issue:

1. **Do not** open a public issue.
2. Email: `sikey-security@proton.me` (replace with a real mailbox when you create one).
3. Include:
   - A description of the issue.
   - Steps to reproduce (if applicable).
   - Any potential impact you can see.

We will:

- Acknowledge receipt as soon as we can.
- Investigate the issue.
- Work with you on responsible disclosure and, if appropriate, credit.
