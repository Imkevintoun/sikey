# SIKEY — Sovereign Identity Key Protocol  
### *Identity Without Exposure.*

SIKEY is an open-source, decentralised, zero-knowledge identity protocol designed to give **humans — not institutions — ownership over their identity** in the digital age.

Modern digital identity systems are being built around centralised databases, biometrics, surveillance metadata, and permanent identifiers tied to every interaction.  
SIKEY provides the opposite:

> **Self-sovereign identity, non-correlatable keys, selective disclosure, and zero-knowledge verification — all without exposing who you are.**

---

# 🚀 Mission

To build a **public, decentralised, censorship-resistant identity layer**  
that allows individuals to:

- Prove information **without revealing personal data**  
- Authenticate **without being tracked**  
- Hold credentials **without registries or surveillance**  
- Access services **without dependency on governments or corporations**  

**SIKEY is identity re-imagined — for freedom, privacy, and digital sovereignty.**

# 🔐 Core Principles

### **1. Self-Sovereignty**
Identity must be generated, held, and controlled by the individual.

### **2. Zero-Knowledge by Default**
Verification without exposure.  
Access without surveillance.

### **3. Selective Disclosure**
Only the required attribute is ever revealed — nothing more.

### **4. Non-Correlation Across Contexts**
Every app, verifier, and session gets a unique, untrackable identity key.

### **5. Decentralised Trust Anchors**
No central authority. No global registry. No identity database.

### **6. Open-Source Transparency**
A protocol governed by its community, not institutions.

# 🧩 How SIKEY Works

SIKEY is built around a single foundational concept:

## **Sovereign Identity Key (SIK)**  
A root cryptographic key from which all identity interactions are derived:

- Device keys  
- App-specific keys  
- Verifier-specific keys  
- Session keys  
- Zero-knowledge proof identities  

Each derived key is isolated and **cannot be linked** to any other.

# 🧱 Architecture Overview

SIKEY is composed of four layers:

### **1. User Layer — SIKEY Wallet**
- Generates the Sovereign Identity Key  
- Stores credentials locally  
- Creates zero-knowledge proofs  

### **2. Issuer Layer**
- Governments  
- Universities  
- Banks  
- Private orgs  
- Web3 protocols  

Issuers issue → users hold → issuers forget.

### **3. Verifier Layer**
Services validate proofs without ever seeing identity.

### **4. Decentralised Trust Registry**
Stores:
- issuer public keys  
- credential schemas  
- revocation commitments  

Stores *nothing* about users.

# 📚 Key Documents

### **📝 Whitepaper v1.1**  
A complete overview of the SIKEY protocol, architecture, and design philosophy.  
**[Download PDF](./docs/whitepaper.md)**  
*(GitHub Releases also include a designed PDF version.)*

### **📜 Manifesto v1.1**  
The philosophical foundation of the SIKEY movement — identity as a human right.  
**[Read Manifesto](./docs/manifesto.md)**  
*(Designed PDF also available in Releases.)*

### **💠 Future Economic Layer (Exploratory)**  
An outline of why SIKEY may introduce a native utility token (SIK Coin) in the future —  
focused on contributor incentives, decentralised governance, and protocol sustainability.  

**[Read SIK Coin Document](./docs/SIK-Coin.md)**  
*(Conceptual only. No live token. No launch planned.)*

### **📘 Specifications**  
SIKEY uses a structured specification process similar to EIPs / ZIPs.

| Spec | Title | Status |
|------|--------|---------|
| **0001** | Vision & Principles | Final |
| **0002** | Identity Model & Key Derivation | Draft |
| **0003** | Credentials & Attestations | (Coming next) |

All specs live in `/specs/`.

# 🤝 Contributing

SIKEY is community-driven.  
Anyone aligned with the mission of digital sovereignty is invited to participate.

Ways to contribute:

- Review specifications  
- Propose new SKIPs (SIKEY Improvement Proposals)  
- Participate in discussions  
- Submit PRs  
- Help with cryptography, ZK circuits, wallets, UX, documentation  

Read the **Contributing Guide**:  
`/CONTRIBUTING.md`

# 🛡 Security

This is an identity protocol — security matters deeply.

See:  
`/SECURITY.md`

If you discover a vulnerability, follow the responsible disclosure process.

# 🌐 License

SIKEY is licensed under the **Apache 2.0 License**, ensuring:

- Open use  
- Open modification  
- No proprietary lock-in  
- No centralised ownership  

---

# 💬 Community

A GitHub Discussion will be opened for:

### **“Welcome to SIKEY — Introduce Yourself & What You Want to Build”**

This will become the entry point for contributors.

More channels (Discord, Matrix, Forum) will follow once the early community forms.

# 🌍 Why SIKEY Matters

Centralised digital identity is becoming the backbone of global governance.  
And it is being built in ways that:

- track humans  
- profile behaviour  
- link data across systems  
- allow conditional access  
- concentrate power  

SIKEY exists to provide the opposite —  
**a decentralised, private, trustless identity layer that protects humanity from identity capture.**

> ***Identity must belong to people — not institutions.***
