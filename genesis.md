# SIKEY — Genesis

SIKEY exists to ensure that identity can be owned and exercised by individuals without requiring permission, central authority, or permanent disclosure.

As economic activity, assets, and access move into digital and tokenised systems, identity becomes the primary enforcement layer. SIKEY was created to prevent identity from becoming a mechanism of control, exclusion, or behavioural compliance.

SIKEY does not define who a person is. It enables only what must be proven, and nothing more.

No global registry, master authority, or irreversible identity shall exist within SIKEY. Identity must remain local, contextual, revocable, and under the sole custody of the individual.

SIKEY is infrastructure, not ideology. It is designed to coexist with institutions without being owned by them, and to serve individuals without representing them.

Any change that centralises control, expands mandatory disclosure, or enables capture violates the purpose of SIKEY.

This protocol exists so that identity remains a tool of agency, not obedience.
